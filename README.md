# ponder
Ponder is a software developed in Python using the Tkinter GUI. The software is designed for schools and universities alike, it prevents the students from swapping applications while giving online MCQ based tests, and doesnt allow to Alt-Tab, Ctrl+F4, or even run task manager. The only way to exit the software is when you have completed the test.
